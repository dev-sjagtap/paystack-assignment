# Rick and Morty Character App

This iOS app is built with **SwiftUI** and demonstrates how to fetch and display character data from the **Rick and Morty API**. The app also uses the **NetStatusPackage** to monitor the network status (i.e., checking if the device is connected to the internet). 

The app consists of two screens:
- **List Screen**: Displays a list of characters.
- **Detail Screen**: Displays detailed information about a selected character.

The app features real-time network connectivity monitoring, and if the device loses connection to the internet, it will inform the user.
